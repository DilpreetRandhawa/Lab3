1. Project Goal 

The goal of this project is to develop Smart Shop, a web and mobile-friendly application that allows users to compare grocery prices across multiple stores (e.g., Walmart, FreshCo, No Frills, and others). The application will display deals, flyers, and store-specific offers, helping users save money and shop more efficiently.
